# Create-Dynamic-SQL-View-in-Python

We will connect to the MS SQL Server Database, access the data and replicate the functionaliy of a stored function that retrieves the data.
We will check if the data is stored locally already, if no then we will download the data. If yes, then we will verify if the data is up to data, and if it is not then we will download the up to data data on the local system.
